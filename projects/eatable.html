      <p>DESCRIPTION.</p>
      <p>(non-technical) Eatable was a startup company I worked at from July 2013 to February 2014. The goal of the company was to provide a service to create more tailored food recommendations. We dubbed it, "The Pandora of Food." During my time there, the idea was in a constant state of flux, and as a result so was the software. The following is just one implementation.</p>
      <p>(technical) The eatable webapp was a nodejs application, with express used as a visual. it was also coded using bootstrap and jade (the node equivalent to HTML). It communicated with a server API and had a number of functions, including....
        <ul>
          <li>logging in and out (through facebook and google) -- node passport was used for this</li>
          <li>adding new dishes to the database</li>
          <li>receiving the dishes of a given user</li>
          <li>upon a click, showing restaurant info. google maps was integrated.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
